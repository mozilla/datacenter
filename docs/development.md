## Run

1. Install Docker
    * [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
2. Run `PORT=3000 docker-compose up`
    * Change the value of `PORT` to use a different port. `PORT` can
      alternatively be exported rather than being prepended to the command.
3. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
